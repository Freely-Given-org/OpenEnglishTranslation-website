                                (transliterations) of these names to make it
                                easier for readers to pronounce them as they
                                come across them, e.g., using <b>f</b> instead
                                of <b>ph</b>, so <i>Epafras</i> instead of{' '}
                                <i>Epaphras</i>. (Oddly, even traditional

                                more wherever possible. So a word like{' '}
                                <i>baptise</i> (which is an adapted
                                transliteration of the Greek verb), actually
                                gets translated, so this example becomes{' '}
                                <i>immerse</i>.

                                translations due to limitations of the original
                                printing processes. The <em>OET</em> fixes the
                                problem where most modern books use{' '}
                                <i>italics</i> for <em>emphasis</em> whereas
                                older Bibles use <i>italics</i> for the words
                                which should actually be <b>deemphasised</b>,
                                i.e., the words which actually <b>aren’t</b> in
                                the original manuscripts!

                                <i>messiah</i>. (It’s not Jesus’ surname!) It
                                seems to make sense to only use one word
                                consistently rather than using two words for the
                                same thing (just because they came from two
                                different languages), so the <em>OET</em> has
                                elected to only use <i>messiah</i>. However,
                                these words actually have a meaning, just as{' '}
                                <i>President</i> is not just a title, but
                                someone who <i>presides</i> over governmental
                                meetings. So going a step further, we have
                                chosen to use the contemporary <b>meaning</b> of
                                the word in the <em>Literal Version</em>. The
                                original meaning is <i>one who is anointed</i>{' '}
                                (by having a hornful of oil poured over them),
                                but we use the extended meaning which is{' '}
                                <i>one who is selected/chosen (by God)</i>.

                                Most readers living in modern democracies have
                                never been familiar with the concept of an
                                ancient king or <i>lord</i> who has the power of
                                life and death over them. Thus the title{' '}
                                <i>Lord Jesus</i> is easily said, yet relatively
                                few actually live with Jesus as the lord of
                                their thoughts and actions and daily activities.
                                (Just think how many would embarrassingly rush
                                to turn off the video they’re streaming if Jesus
                                appeared in the room.) As a reaction to the word{' '}
                                <i>Lord</i> seemingly becoming so cliché for

                                least think a little more about what the concept
                                might mean. (The word <i>boss</i> felt a little
                                informal.)

                                because the concept of capital and small letters

                                Because the <em>Literal Version</em> so closely
                                follows the original languages, it’s important
                                to remember that words often don’t match
                                one-to-one between languages. This is one reason
                                why the <em>OET-LV</em> reads strangely: because
                                we try to avoid using different English words if
                                we can; knowing that the <em>OET-LV</em> will
                                not be natural English. Again, this is because
                                we want the <em>OET-LV</em> to be a window into
                                what’s actually written in the original
                                languages. For fluent English (like in the{' '}
                                <em>Readers’ Version</em>) the same Greek word
                                might require several different translations
                                when used in different contexts. For example,
                                the Greek word translated <i>raise</i> in the{' '}
                                <em>OET-LV</em> would likely require the

                                    Alert readers might be aware that there’s a
                                    play on words here in the gospels. When
                                    Jesus talked about himself{' '}
                                    <i>being raised up</i>, it was deliberately
                                    ambiguous because his hearers didn’t
                                    understand until right near the end that he
                                    was going to be executed so coming back to
                                    life wasn’t on their minds. So we, looking
                                    back in history, know that he was talking
                                    about coming back to life, but at the time,
                                    they were just very confused and didn’t
                                    understand what he meant. But amazingly, as
                                    well as referring to his resurrection,{' '}
                                    <i>raising</i> also refers to his
                                    crucifixion as the victims on the stakes
                                    were also <i>raised</i>. (See{' '}
                                    <a href='JHN.html#C3V14'>John 3:14</a>.)
                                    Sadly, it’s not usually possible to make a
                                    translation easy to read and understand in
                                    our current times, without losing some of
                                    the underlying meaning or ambiguities or
                                    word-plays that were presented to the
                                    original hearers. That’s exactly why it’s
                                    good to have <em>two</em> different
                                    translations side-by-side!

                                <em>Literal Version</em>. Because it’s not
                                designed to be used alone (but rather alongside
                                the <em>Readers’ Version</em>), it’s{' '}
                                <b>much more literal</b> than most other
                                “literal versions”. You’ll quickly notice
                                lighter colours that mark the deemphasis of
                                words that had to be added to make the English
                                sentences even make sense. But there’s at least
                                two other things that aren’t necessarily changed
                                in the English <em>Literal Version</em>:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>
                                        Other languages use the negative
                                        differently, especially when it’s
                                        doubled or tripled in the sentence. If
                                        you don’t understand this, you could
                                        easily think that the original means the
                                        opposite of what the words actually
                                        appear to say. For example the double
                                        negative: “You are<span>_</span> not{' '}
                                        <span>_</span>caring<span>_</span>about
                                        no one.” (adapted from Matthew 22:16).
                                        In natural, fluent English, we would
                                        have to reverse the second negative to
                                        get the expected meaning, ending up with{' '}
                                        <i>anyone</i> as you’ll find in the{' '}
                                        <em>Readers’ Version</em>. But in Greek,
                                        the second negative adds emphasis rather
                                        than reversing the first negative. So
                                        our <em>Literal Version</em> shows you
                                        the words that are actually there (in
                                        the Greek in this case).

                                        implied to the original reader, but
                                        which the modern English reader finds
                                        strange, e.g., a son may be divided
                                        against his father, and a daughter her
                                        mother. The elided words are “may be
                                        divided against”.

                                carefully for how it is translated into modern,

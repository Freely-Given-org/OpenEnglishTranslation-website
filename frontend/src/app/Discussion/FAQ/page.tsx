                            <em>OET</em> translation has been on hold for
                            several years as we were asked to help with other
                            projects, but we were finally able to resume
                            full-time work on the <em>OET</em> in July 2022. Any
                            Bible translation takes several years of work, but
                            the first draft of the New Testament was completed
                            in March 2024, and Old Testament translation is
                            ongoing. Further progress depends on how many
                            volunteers we can recruit to help. (For example,
                            without any other software developers, time has to
                            be taken off translation to develop sample websites
                            and apps in order to even display the first draft.)

                                Some old words and grammatical forms drop out of
                                common use. Some old words gain new shades of
                                meaning and new words are introduced. So a dated
                                translation may not speak well to the current
                                generation and new translations are required.

                                There are many decisions to be made when doing a
                                translation, and the translators usually follow
                                a series of policies which are decided by
                                thinking about what audience they are hoping to
                                reach. The best Bible for a teenager to use for
                                personal reading and devotions may not be the
                                same one that a Bible teacher will want to
                                preach from. Protestants may make different
                                translation decisions from Catholics, and
                                similarly for other distinct groups. A
                                publishing company might want to target a
                                certain segment of the market. Hence, many
                                different translations arise.

                            Yes, that’s a fair question and one that we have to
                            admit to. It’s a compromise that we feel is
                            worthwile because of our priority goal of making the

                            misfit. For example, all English translations use
                            the words ‘priest’ and ‘soldier’, but those Biblical
                            roles were a very long way from the work of modern
                            priests and soldiers, so the reader ALWAYS has to be

                                There are many parts of the world now where
                                English is spoken as a lingua franca or language
                                of wider communication. Sometimes English skills
                                become helpful to gain employment or even just
                                to show increased status. Sometimes when
                                different groups meet (even at a church
                                meeting), English can become their common
                                language for worship or preaching. In some
                                cases, translators of a local language will wish
                                to publish a diglot—two languages side-by-side
                                in a printed version. In that case, it’s not
                                unusual for people to even learn English by
                                comparing the Bible text in their language with
                                the English translation beside it. A freely
                                available English translation would make all of
                                the above scenarios possible without being
                                dependent on the whims of the copyright owner of
                                the English translation.

                                you will find a copyright notice along with
                                permission given to quote a limited number of
                                verses. This would normally allow you to copy a
                                few verses into your church bulletin, but would
                                not normally allow you to publish a Bible-study
                                with the full Bible text conveniently included.
                                The <em>OET</em> would allow churches and other

                            The <em>Literal Version (OET-LV)</em> uses underline
                            characters to join words which are represented by
                            one word in the original language. For example,{' '}
                            <em>he_said</em> would indicate that these two
                            English words are represented by just one word in
                            the original language and there is no separate word
                            specifying who is the <em>he</em>. The <em>OET</em>
                             also includes grammatical and semantic tagging. For
                            example, if the text says <em>
                                gave it to him

                            tagging is done in the text files using special
                            characters, e.g., <em>him=PDavid</em> tells us that
                            the <em>him</em> referred to is the person David. A
                            full list of tags and special characters can be

                            Well yeah, tradition is a wonderful thing, and you
                            can be assured that there will be a variant with
                            some more traditional design decisions like the
                            traditional book order. However, there’s also no
                            need to be shackled to tradition. Remember that many
                            Bible ‘books’ started as individual scrolls. Some
                            writings were split so those scrolls wouldn’t be too
                            physically big and heavy, and we may join them
                            togther again, e.g., 1 &amp; 2 Samuel. The default
                            <em>OET</em> New Testament will begin with John’s
                            account, which also has the advantage of placing
                            Luke’s two accounts right after each other.

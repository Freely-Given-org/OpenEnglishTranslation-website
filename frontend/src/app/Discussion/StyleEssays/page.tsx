                            The <em>OET</em> uses capital letters at the start
                            of sentences and to proper nouns (and we include
                            ‘God’ in that) as per standard, modern English, but
                            we don’t add artificial capitalisation to pronouns
                            and we try to limit the addition of capitalisation
                            in terms like ‘Kingdom of Heaven’. We say
                            ‘addition’, because there’s no capitalisation at all
                            in the original Hebrew and Greek manuscripts.

                            capitalisation in the different versions displayed

                            English translations. I’ve heard people say how they
                            like the King James Bible because it’s so ‘poetic’.

                            which I grew up singing: “Thy word is a lamp unto my
                            feet, and a light unto my path.” Of course, we can
                            see that this <em>is</em> Hebrew poetry—not because
                            it rhymes (like a lot of English poetry), but
                            because it expresses the same thought twice in a
                            row, but using different words. But to a modern
                            English reader, it also sounds <em>cute</em> because
                            of the archaic pronoun ‘Thy’ and the use of ‘unto’.
                            It sounds romantic because an oil lamp sounds more
                            inviting than just turning on a torch/flashlight,
                            and walking on a rough forest path sounds more
                            inviting than walking on the nicely levelled
                            footpath/sidewalk that we’re more likely to do these
                            days. These archaic and old-fashioned English words
                            and cultural concepts are what makes that language
                            seem poetic, even though the Hebrew author (and
                            readers) considered it poetic for entirely different
                            reasons (that many English readers don’t even spot).

                            All to say that our notions of ‘poetic’ are often
                            misconceived, and certainly the{' '}

                            It’s not uncommon to find extra explanations in the
                            Bible text, and they’re not always highly relevant
                            or interesting to modern readers. Also, sometimes
                            this material makes the text hard to read aloud
                            because there’s it’s hard to discover the essential
                            elements of the sentence to get the stress and
                            emphasis correct. So the <em>OET-RV</em> doesn’t
                            hesitate to move this material into parentheses,
                            thus clearly marking it as non-essential to the main

                            modern reader). However, like any other added
                            material, these parenthetical statements are
                            displayed in a lighter colour grey text so that’s
                            it’s clear to the reader what the editors have

                        <p>
                            The <em>OET Literal Version</em> closely follows the
                            original texts so no anachronisms should occur
                            (beyond glosses for individual words), but it’s very
                            different for the <em>Readers’ Version</em> where

                            . So we definitely use things like modern metric

                            anachronisms since those units didn’t exist in the

                            However, we’re quite prepared to go beyond that.
                            Should we change ‘sundial’ to ‘clock’? Well, we’d be
                            prepared to make changes like that if we felt that
                            it would help the understanding of the modern
                            reader. (In that particular case, we would probably
                            feel that the average, educated reader should
                            probably know what a sundial is, even if they’ve
                            never personally seen one. But obviously that
                            conclusion might not be correct for all readers, so
                            of course our renderings cannot possibly please
                            everybody. The younger generations tend to learn
                            more from videos and short articles rather than by
                            reading a range of literature, so it’s well known
                            that their vocabulary sizes are declining on
                            average. However, do note that making an

                            one of the primary goals of the <em>OET</em>.)

                            So what about ‘casting lots’ versus ‘drawing straws’
                            or ‘throwing dice’ (or maybe even ‘flipping a
                            coin’). Well, firstly we consider ‘casting’ to be
                            archaic English outside of fishing or moulten metal
                            contexts, so at best we’d want ‘throwing lots (on
                            the ground)’ (as distinct from throwing like a
                            cricket ball). But what is a ‘lot’ in that context?
                            (It can also refer to your allocated piece of land.)
                            Well, we don’t actually know. Probably stones or
                            sticks, but possibly even a special carved object
                            somewhat like a dice, and of course the practise
                            likely evolved throughout the millenia. (The Bible
                            covers some 4,000 years of history.) In this case,
                            the <em>OET-RV</em> probably won’t hesitate to use a
                            modern word like ‘dice’ even though that is clearly
                            an anachronism. Why stumble the modern reader over
                            something we don’t even know anyway? (If you want

                            the OT has ‘בֵּית’ (bēyt), as the most common
                            translation of that word would be ‘house’. Look at{' '}

                            As we work our way through translating the
                            scriptures, it’s very obvious (and rather sad) that{' '}
                            <b>
                                many translations make word and punctuation
                                decisions around verse breaks
                            </b>
                            . (While it’s neither our aim or desire here to
                            criticise other English translations, we do feel
                            that it’s important to point this out.) We find it
                            very sad to see how so many Bible users take
                            ‘verses’ (a totally 100% artificial construct
                            superimposed on the scriptural text) out of context,
                            and no Bible translation should encourage this
                            problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We have found this problem to be especially
                            noticeable in the collection of Songs/Psalms, but
                            it’s not uncommon throughout the scriptures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So how’s it obvious? Well, simply by looking at the
                            number of sentences in most English Bibles that
                            start a verse (and the sentence) with ‘For’. (We’ve
                            also written about that specifically{' '}
                            <Link href='/Discussion/WordEssays#for'>here</Link>
                            .) Simple logic says that we rarely start sentences
                            in modern English with ‘For’ and so using ‘Because’
                            is more natural. But we were all also taught at
                            school to try to avoid starting sentences with
                            ‘Because’, because it’s a linking word and much of
                            the time it should be a continuation of the previous
                            sentence. (If you want examples, just skim down the
                            left of{' '}

                            </Link>{' '}
                            and note how many sentences/verses start with ‘But’
                            or ‘For’ and ask yourself the question, ‘Would it
                            have been more natural for that sentence to have
                            been joined to the previous one?’ or you can do the
                            same thing in Psalms in your printed Bible.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So it’s important to always remember that when the
                            Biblical authors wrote a document, or a song, or a
                            letter, they weren’t filling in a table of short
                            sentences in boxes in a spreadsheet (that’s more or
                            less how ‘verses’ are represented inside computers),
                            but they were trying to express the natural language
                            in their minds onto parchment. There are some good
                            reasons (often related to reading level) to try to
                            keep translated sentences shortish, but how often
                            have we lost the connections and the flow, and
                            consequently encouraged snippets to be memorised and
                            quoted out of context?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Note: the same can be said about chapter breaks, but
                            although that’s not an uncommon problem, it
                            obviously doesn’t affect the reader as numerously as
                            the verse break issue does.

                            decisions that led to the somewhat sad state of our

                            the way back to Roman times. Although the earliest
                            New Testament manuscripts that we have are all Koine
                            Greek and the Hebrew scriptures (Old Testament) had

                            Pope in the late 300’s that later came to be called

                            ’ (meaning ‘common’/‘ordinary’). This translation
                            was a great asset to the church, but the problem was
                            that over a period of roughly one thousand years,
                            this Latin translation remained highly revered by
                            the church even when the average person in England
                            could no longer understand Latin. (This lead to a
                            period of terrible corruption in the church once the
                            ordinary people no longer had access to the
                            scriptures in their own language and so had to rely
                            purely on what they were taught from the pulpit.)

                            In the mid 1300’s, John Wycliffe started to
                            translate the Bible into the language of the people
                            (that we now call ‘middle-English’), but

                            , but also heavily influenced by Latin and French.
                            As the (originally Germanic) ‘J’ (pronounced like
                            English ‘Y’) changed its pronunciation, English
                            words like ‘Iesus’ ended up as ‘Jesus’ even though

                            In terms of spelling, the first letter of a word is
                            quite vital. You can often get your spell-checker to
                            complete a word for you if you know how it begins.
                            So sadly, we now have a situation in English Bibles,
                            where the first letter of many, many names (starting
                            with ‘J’) is wrong. If you visit Israel, you’ll
                            notice that all Hebrew speakers will start the names
                            of those places with a ‘Y’ sound.

                            What’s more, a number of Hebrew names (like
                            ‘Ishmael’, ‘Isaac’, ‘Israel’, and ‘Isaiah’) have a

                        <p>
                            Then names like ‘Isaiah’ (and ‘Jeremiah’, ‘Uzziah’,
                            and many others) have an ‘i’ in the middle that
                            should be a ‘y’. The transliterated Hebrew is more
                            like ‘Yeshayahu’, and then

                            Our emotional attachment to Bible translations
                        </h1>
                        <p>
                            One thing that’s become increasingly apparent to me
                            as I’ve worked on the{' '}
                            <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible (
                            <em>OET</em>), is how much that Western Protestant
                            Christians are <b>emotionally</b> attached to their
                            favourite Bible translation(s). (This likely applies
                            to other groups as well, but I can’t speak for
                            them.) Despite being mono-lingual in most cases,
                            they’ll tell you that their Bibles{' '}
                            <em>feel accurate</em>, but of course, that’s an
                            argument from emotions rather than from logic or
                            linguistics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Firstly there’s the KJB-only movement—a group
                            (particularly in the USA) that claims that the King
                            James Bible (a 400+ year old British English
                            translation that received hundreds of corrections
                            until 1769 and still contains some mistakes) is
                            somehow more perfect than any modern English
                            translation. Extremist holders of this view even
                            believe that missionaries must teach this
                            out-of-date and difficult-to-understand English all
                            around the world. We find those positions so
                            ridiculous that we don’t bother refuting them, but{' '}

                            have done that very well. All we want to say here is
                            that we find KJB-onlyism to be an emotional
                            attachment to a particular (old) English Bible
                            translation without any logical reasoning—more a
                            case of religiosity than reasoned God-following.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Secondly, many people just trust their denomination
                            or pastor about their Bible translation. While this
                            isn’t necessarily a bad thing, the expertise of most
                            pastors isn’t in linguistics and translation, nor
                            (by definition, since pastor means ‘shepherd’) is it
                            in sharing the Christian message with unchurched
                            people (evangelism) who don’t necessarily know all
                            the Christian jargon (‘Christianese’) yet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Thirdly, most English Bibles are published by large
                            multi-million dollar businesses with marketing
                            departments. These organisations are very involved
                            in advertising, including emails, videos, and other
                            solicitation where they often claim their
                            translation is best in class. Every single one of
                            them knows that no Biblical character is named
                            ‘James’ (just ask any European what their Bibles
                            call that book), but marketing departments don’t
                            want to rock the <del>boat</del> sales by making
                            those kinds of corrections.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Finally, there’s very many of us (yes, we were
                            exactly the same ourselves) who would read about{' '}
                            <em>the great earthquake</em> in Rev 16:18{' '}
                            <b>without ever noticing or thinking about</b> how
                            such a destructive event could be called ‘great’ (as
                            we mostly use the word today, like a ‘great
                            dinner’). Or those who can quote John 3:16 from
                            memory without ever giving a single thought to why
                            it usually begins with the word ‘For’. Or those who
                            can easily sing <em>Great is thy faithfulness</em>{' '}
                            without ever realising that those words are in the
                            wrong order for modern speech.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At this point, most people tell me that the Bible is{' '}
                            <b>poetic</b>. Yes, some of it certainly is, but the
                            great majority of it is not poetry but{' '}
                            <b>narrative</b>. So no, the reason it sounds
                            ‘quaint’ is not that the Hebrew or Greek was quaint,
                            but simply because the English translations that we
                            get emotionally attached to still have much
                            old-fashioned use of English words and phrases—many
                            times following the original languages too closely
                            instead of translating into our language, e.g., with
                            phrases like <em>son of God</em> instead of the more
                            up-to-date <em>God’s son</em>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So yes, we’re aware that the Open English
                            Translation will likely take a decade or so to make
                            any major mark on the Bible market due to emotional
                            attachment and other factors (not to mention that it
                            won’t be finished for at least another two years).
                            But we’re aiming for the 2030’s generation who’ll be
                            looking for a reliable Bible translation in the
                            language that they actually speak.

                            What about carrying a thick book around under your

                            called ‘God’s Word<b>s</b>’? Surely there’s a lot of

                            If you grew up in and around churches and Bibles
                            like me, then you probably didn’t think about those
                            questions either? In fact, it’s only now that I’m in
                            my later years that I’ve even thought twice about
                            it. We can be so used to speaking in our own
                            Christianese dialect that we forget that normal

                            Now it’s true that the mother of a the rebellious
                            teenager might tell him/her: “I’d like to have a
                            word with you about the language that you’ve been
                            using.” Or someone might ask, “What’s the word on
                            the street about which Bible translation is best?”
                            So yes, some of that older usage still lingers on in
                            certain contexts. But would your president or
                            prime-minister give ‘a word’ to the press about the
                            new tax policy? Probably not.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Bible is still often called ‘The Word of God’.
                            That’s simply archaic English. The word ‘word’ in
                            our English nearly always refers to these groups of
                            letters on this page separated by spaces. It’s time
                            that God started speaking our language in English
                            Bibles. At least ‘The Message’ translation gave some
                            thought as to how modern readers talk (and that was
                            some two decades ago now).

                        <p>
                            There’s a lot of other hang-over vocabulary that
                            only Christians now use. For example, have you been{' '}
                            <i>delivered</i> from your evil habits? Talking to a
                            gang member on the street, he’s not likely to tell
                            you that he’s hoping his brother will be delivered
                            out of prison this month. In mainstream English we
                            still use ‘delivered’ for pizzas and babies, but no
                            longer for chains and prisons. Being delivered is
                            retained in other contexts as a form of church
                            jargon—talking like someone out of a previous
                            century. Nowadays in real life, we are more likely
                            to use ‘set free’ for prisons and sinful habits.

                            The most memorised Bible verse in the world was John

                        <p>
                            So here’s my first question:{' '}
                            <b>
                                What does the conjunction ‘For’ mean in that
                                sentence?
                            </b>{' '}
                            You see, I don’t start sentences with ‘For’ in my
                            New Zealand English dialect (except perhaps in the
                            short sentence ‘For what?’ where it’s a
                            preposition). Perhaps it means ‘Because’ in John
                            3:16, but if we substitute that in, then the
                            sentence sounds wrong out of context because it
                            seems to need to connect to something (which it
                            actually should—it should be connected to the
                            previous verses). However, ‘Because’ does seem to be
                            the correct modern replacement for ‘For’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So now my second question:{' '}
                            <b>
                                In your dialect of English, how often do you
                                start sentences with ‘For’?
                            </b>{' '}
                            I’ve been listening carefully for over a year now
                            and have <b>never</b> heard or read it in that time.
                            (Please <Link href='/About/Contact'>contact</Link>{' '}
                            me with the sentence and the context if you hear
                            someone say it.) Yet ‘For’ is still there even in
                            many modern English Bible translations, e.g.,{' '}
                            <Link href='https://Freely-Given.org/OBD/NET/byC/JHN_C3.htm#Top'>
                                this fairly modern one
                            </Link>
                            . (Search the page for the capitalised conjunction
                            ‘For’ and for the conjunction ‘for’ after a comma. I
                            counted seven in John 3 in <i>NET</i>.)
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So here’s the rub: If so-called ‘modern’ English
                            Bible translations frequently use the conjunction
                            ‘For’, but if it’s never/rarely used in our speech,
                            then the conclusion surely must be that{' '}

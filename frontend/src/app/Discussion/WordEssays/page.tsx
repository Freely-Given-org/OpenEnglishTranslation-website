                            Trying to nudge English Bible translation into the
                            21st century
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            If you try to read many of the books that call
                            themselves Bibles<sup>*</sup>, you’ll find that the
                            text often feels very formal, in fact so much so
                            that many readers now expect that a Bible
                            translation <em>must</em> sound formal. What most
                            readers don’t realise, is that there are three main
                            reasons that Bible translations sound ‘formal’ or
                            ‘quaint’:
                            <br />
                            <b>1.</b> Because Hebrew or Greek word order is
                            often carried through into English translations,
                            e.g., ‘son of Abraham’ rather than the more natural
                            modern English ‘Abraham’s son’,
                            <br />
                            <b>2.</b> Because Hebrew or Greek idioms are often
                            carried through into English translations, e.g.,
                            ‘God delivered him from the hand of the Philistines’
                            when we’d never use that idiom in natural English
                            speech.
                            <br />
                            <b>3.</b> Because ancient English word choices (some
                            going back all the way to John Wycliffe<sup>**</sup>{' '}
                            in the 1300’s) are still present in so-called
                            ‘modern’ English translations, e.g., using ‘For’
                            instead of ‘Because’, using ‘great’ where we would
                            no longer use it, or using ‘wild beasts’ instead of
                            ‘wild animals’.

                            ‘For God so loved the world…’ So what does the word
                            ‘For’ mean at the beginning of that very well-known
                            sentence? Most people we’ve questioned can’t really
                            answer that question, although many do realise that
                            the modern equivalent would be ‘Because’, but then
                            that confuses them because they never memorised what

                            the beginning of a sentence in modern English and so
                            sadly, they hadn’t even asked themselves what it’s

                            Sadly, even many English translations that claim to
                            be ‘modern’ or ‘new’ are still full of archaic
                            sentences starting with ‘For’.

                        <p>
                            The English word ‘of’ seems so small and
                            insignificant that it surely couldn’t have too much
                            effect on a modern Bible translation? But it does,
                            and this issue has become more significant over the
                            centuries because of English language change.

                            Imagine if I said, ‘I’m just going to drop in at the
                            house of Simon.’ Sounds a bit weird? But in the
                            1300’s when John Wycliffe was translating from Latin
                            to what we now call ‘Middle English’,{' '}
                            <Link href='https://Freely-Given.org/OBD/par/ACT/C10V17.htm#Wyc'>
                                ‘the house of Simon’
                            </Link>{' '}
                            was a quite normal construction. However now, some
                            seven hundred years later, it’s more normal to say
                            ‘Simon’s house’. The <em>OET</em>
                             tries hard to use modern English forms as much as
                            possible, however many of the archaic forms are
                            still carried over into other English translations
                            that would consider themselves to be ‘modern’, e.g.,
                            ‘hand of God’, ‘temple of God’, ‘Son of God’, ‘Son
                            of Man’, etc., etc. As mentioned above, one of the
                            reasons why so many of our Bibles sound ‘quaint’ or
                            ‘authoritative’ (depending on your perspective) is
                            that they tradition above natural language use and
                            so they sound more ‘formal’ than more modern English
                            narratives and essays.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There is another problem with interpreting the Greek
                            genitive in that it can be ambiguous. Consider ‘love
                            of God’ in the sentence ‘The love of God for people
                            is amazing.’ This could be rewritten as ‘God’s love
                            for people is amazing.’ On the contrary, ‘Mary
                            really lives out her love of God.’ Here ‘love of
                            God’ can’t be replaced with ‘God’s love’ but rather
                            with ‘love for God’, hence ‘Mary really lives out
                            her love for God.’ So we realise that the ‘of’
                            (Greek genitive) form is ambiguous: it can often be
                            translated with the English possessive form (usually
                            expressed with apostrophe in modern English) but
                            sometimes we must choose a different English
                            construction, and occasionally we might bring the
                            ambiguous form across to English because we can’t
                            determine which option the writer intended.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All to say that you’ll find many less ‘of’
                            constructions in the <em>OET</em> and although that
                            might make it sound unfamiliar to long-term Bible
                            readers, it will feel considerably less ‘quaint’ or
                            ‘weird’ to first-time readers.

                            Was everyone in the Hebrew Scriptures sitting or
                            lying down when they were told by someone else to go
                            somewhere? So many English translations say
                            something like ‘So he <b>got up</b> and went to …’.
                            In modern-English that would seem to normally mean
                            ‘he
                            <b>got out (of bed)</b> and went …’, although it
                            could also mean ‘he <b>stood up (from the table)</b>{' '}
                            and went …’. That probably wasn’t the word picture
                            in the mind of the original author. It’s more likely
                            to mean ‘he <b>packed up</b> and went …’ or ‘he{' '}
                            <b>got ready</b> and went …’ or even just ‘he{' '}
                            <b>departed</b> and walked to …’ in that context it
                            seems.

                            Pretty much the only things that get ‘delivered’ in
                            modern times are packages, pizzas, and babies.
                            Slaves taken by ISIS get ‘rescued’ and God might
                            help the army to ‘defeat’ or ‘conquer’ the enemy,
                            not ‘deliver them into your hand’. Addicts ‘break’
                            the habit. Prisoners (or sinners) get ‘released’ or
                            ‘set free’ rather than getting ‘delivered’.

                            modern English, the word ‘great’ typically has a
                            positive connotation of being ‘good’. However, back
                            in the 1300’s when John Wycliffe translated the New
                            Testament into English (from Latin), the word
                            ‘great’ mostly meant ‘large’. So in{' '}

                            , he used that word to describe a terrible
                            earthquake. No doubt any modern reader who’s had
                            their house damaged in an earthquake wouldn’t
                            naturally use the phase ‘great earthquake’ to
                            describe the frightening event. However, many recent
                            English Bible translations still do just that.

                        <p>
                            In the past, you might have taken a tour of an
                            African safari park to view the ‘wild beasts’, but
                            nowadays, we would be more likely to call them ‘wild
                            animals’. The word ‘beast’ does linger on in English
                            in specific contexts such as ‘a farmer killing a
                            beast’ (meaning a cow). However, apart from ‘Beauty
                            and the Beast’, modern English generally favours the
                            word ‘animal’ over ‘beast’. Tragically though, even
                            quite modern English Bible translations persist in
                            their use of the word ‘beast’, most noticeably in
                            Yohan’s Revelation, but it’s likely producing the
                            wrong word picture in the minds of many readers.

                            Sadly, the word ‘ark’ raises connotation of a
                            boat-shaped object for modern readers—perhaps
                            largely influenced by (inaccurate?) Noah’s Ark
                            picture books. Of course, the big problem with that
                            is when you come to the ‘Ark of the Covenant’ and
                            try to figure out the connection.

                            …’ A godly person shouldn’t ‘stand in the way of
                            sinners’, i.e., ‘Don’t try to prevent sinners from
                            doing anything they want’? No, that’s not what it’s

                            We are currently in ‘first-draft mode’. This means
                            that we're trying to fill in all 31,102 Bible verses
                            with text, so that we have a Bible that we can at
                            least start reading and find every reference.
                            However, drafting is only stage one of a
                            multi-stage, multi-year project.

                        <p>
                            In our <em>OET Readers’ Version</em> translation, we
                            now attempt to mark up where we change it from a
                            literal translation, e.g., if we change the ‘The
                            wealthy man says’ to ‘Wealthy people say’ then we've
                            made a change in <em>number</em> (i.e., from
                            singular to plural) and we mark that. You can see
                            the kinds of things that we annotate on our{' '}

                        <p>
                            Anyway, the disclaimer is that we didn’t do so much
                            of that markup when we started on translating ‘The
                            Messianic Update’ (the ‘New Testament’), but we do
                            intend to update that markup on the next pass
                            through those documents/‘books’.

                                Note: That additional markup will only be
                                visible in online versions—only ‘added’ words
                                will be visible in print versions (deemphasised
                                in gray—not emphasied in <i>italics</i> like in
                                older translations).

                        <p>
                            The spelling of the names of the characters in our
                            modern English Bibles has a long, and sometimes sad,
                            history. Sad because a number of accidents of
                            history makes common modern-English Biblical names
                            very distant from their origins—in fact, sometimes
                            so much so that those people probably wouldn’t have
                            even turned around if you’d called them with the
                            common English pronunciations because they wouldn’t
                            even recognise that they were being called. Then,
                            believe it or not, we live in a world where some
                            people don’t even realise that the great majority of
                            the characters in the Bible were Jewish, even Jesus.
                            All of this can lead to a sad state of Biblical
                            ignorance.

                        <p>
                            The main problem is that names of characters from
                            the Hebrew Scriptures (commonly called the ‘Old
                            Testament’){' '}
                            <b>
                                went from Hebrew to Greek to Latin to
                                middle-English (influenced by German spelling)
                                to modern-English
                            </b>
                            , so by time we get them in our language, they don’t
                            look/sound very Hebrew any more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ‘What does it matter?’ you might ask. Well,
                            hopefully you would realise that speakers of another
                            language might mispronounce your name. ‘Robert’ is
                            often pronounced more like ‘Luber’ by Korean
                            speakers. (Some languages don’t have ‘r’ or don’t
                            distinguish ‘l’ from ‘r’. Some languages don’t allow
                            two consonants to be together in one syllable
                            (called ‘consonant clusters’). So ‘Luber’ would be a
                            good approximation of ‘Robert’—at least it’s got the
                            right number of syllables. What we would hope is
                            that it’s pronounced with respect, i.e., that the
                            Korean speaker made an effort to pronounce it as
                            closely as possible to how I would say it. Compare
                            that to the three syllable name ‘Yeshu'a’. Most
                            English dialects don’t use the glottal stop so we
                            can easily understand it coming out as ‘Yeshuwa’.
                            Now English has all those sounds. But ‘Jesus’ seems
                            miles off. The first consonant is wrong, the ‘sh’ is
                            unnecessarily changed to ‘s’ (because Greek doesn’t
                            have ‘sh’ even though English does), and the final
                            ‘s’ consonant is unnecessarily added (when English,
                            unlike some other languages, DOES allow syllables to
                            end with a vowel) and it’s been reduced to two
                            syllables from three. (The reason that we’ve ended
                            up with ‘Jesus’ is that the Greek ‘Yaysous’ went
                            through some English spelling and pronunciation
                            changes and ending up starting with the modern ‘j’
                            sound.)

                            The <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible
                            has a goal of improving Biblical understanding, and
                            this extends to trying to improve the accuracy of
                            Biblical names. However, we too are restrained by
                            not being able to alter history, so this goal
                            doesn’t mean that we insist on our readers learning
                            how to pronounce Hebrew or Greek. Unfortunately
                            then, our solution will only ever be a compromise
                            solution, which will sadly frustrate some purists.
                            The <em>OET</em> is a compromise, in fact, every
                            Bible translation is always a compromise in{' '}
                            <em>many</em> ways (even if most of their marketing
                            departments don’t try to highlight that).

                                has doubles of some consonants, which are
                                pronounced slightly differently, but which we
                                don’t have enough English letters to represent,
                                including two ‘h’s, two ‘k’s, two ‘s’s, two ‘t’s
                                and two glottal stops. On the other hand, ‘s’
                                and ‘sh’ are regarded as a single consonant in

                            to adapt. (We also have to adapt the vowels, but

                            own modernised transliteration scheme for the Hebrew
                            letters. If the first Hebrew letter is quite
                            different from the English spelling, we will
                            sometimes add the English spelling in parentheses,
                            e.g., ‘Yēshūˊa/(Jeshua)’.

                            how names like ‘Yisrā<sup>ʼēl</sup>’ (Israel) and
                            ‘Nəḩem<sup>yāh</sup>’ (Nehemiah, but it’s only three
                            syllables in Hebrew) have the shortened form of
                            God’s name superscripted to help make it more

                            However, the names are more similar to the Hebrew
                            pronunciation than the traditional (poor) English
                            versions.

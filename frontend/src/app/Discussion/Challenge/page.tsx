                            The <em>OET</em> is currently being drafted and a
                            lot of content, consistency, and format checking is
                            still to come. However, if you find a typo or an
                            inaccuracy, <b>please don’t just ignore it</b>. Open
                            an{' '}

                            and type in a description of the problem so we can
                            investigate it. If it’s a typo or a simple
                            inconsistency, no need to make any justification for
                            a fix. (Or if you're familiar with Git, go ahead and
                            submit a merge request / PR.)

                            However, if it’s a theological or interpretation
                            issue, the more documentation or support for your
                            suggestion that you can give us in writing up the
                            issue, the better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Alternatively, you can submit a typo or other error

                            and then we’ll either create a new issue ourselves
                            on GitHub, or fix it immediately in the source
                            files.

                            We aim to keep improving the <em>OET</em> to ensure
                            that it’s a reliable, quality translation that’ll be
                            useful for the next decade. Thanks in advance for
                            your help in doing this.

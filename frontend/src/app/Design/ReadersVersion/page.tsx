                                the history and legacy of English Bibles now
                                goes back for hundreds of years, many things
                                have been carried over that readers don’t even
                                realise. For example, we all smile at Yoda
                                saying, “Strong is the force.” That’s because
                                naturally we would say, “The force is strong.”
                                So think about “

                                if you look carefully.) But our aim isn’t at all
                                to criticise those who came before (because we
                                very-much build on their shoulders)—we just want
                                our readers to be able to share the Good News of
                                Jesus the messiah with others, without them

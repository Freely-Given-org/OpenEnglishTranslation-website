                                goes back for hundreds of years, many things
                                have been carried over that readers don’t even
                                realise. For example, we all smile at Yoda
                                saying, “Strong is the force.” That’s because
                                naturally we would say, “The force is strong.”
                                So think about “

                                if you look carefully.) But our aim isn’t at all
                                to criticise those who came before (because we
                                very-much build on their shoulders)—we just want
                                our readers to be able to share the Good News of
                                Jesus the messiah with others, without them
                                thinking that Christians speak like dinosaurs

                            language’, is a principle of ‘non-translation’ (and
                            most so-called ‘literal’ Bibles don’t actually do it
                            consistently despite their claim on the cover). A

                            Most words have a <b>range of meaning</b>, e.g.,
                            ‘cold’, ‘warm’, or ‘hot’ each refer to a range of
                            temperatures. So too with verbs, ‘hit’, ‘beat’,
                            ‘bash’, and ‘flatten’ might each refer to striking a

                            of force. When translating words from other

                                English example is ‘kick the bucket’ where you
                                might understand what a ‘kick’ involves, and you
                                might know what a ‘bucket’ is, yet you might not
                                be aware that together as a clause, it means ‘to
                                die’. A{' '}

                                example describes Yahweh as being ‘long of
                                nostril’ which has traditionally been translated
                                as ‘long-suffering’, but more likely as
                                ‘patient’ in a modern translation.

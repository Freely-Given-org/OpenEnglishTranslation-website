                                Most dialects of modern English don’t
                                distinguish between <i>you (singular)</i>{' '}

                                distinguish these, so in order to indicate this

                                Because the <em>Literal Version</em> so closely
                                follows the original languages, it’s important
                                to remember that words often don’t match
                                one-to-one between languages. This is one reason
                                why the <em>OET-LV</em> reads strangely: because
                                we try to avoid using different English words if
                                we can—knowing that the <em>OET-LV</em> will not
                                be natural English. Again, this is because we
                                want the <em>OET-LV</em> to be a window into
                                what’s actually written in the original
                                languages. For fluent English (like in the{' '}
                                <em>Readers’ Version</em>) the same Greek word
                                might require several different translations
                                when used in different contexts. For example,
                                the Greek word translated <i>raise</i> in the{' '}
                                <em>OET-LV</em> would likely require the

                                    Alert readers might be aware that there’s a
                                    play on words here in the gospels. When
                                    Jesus talked about himself{' '}
                                    <i>being raised up</i>, it was deliberately
                                    ambiguous because his hearers didn’t
                                    understand until right near the end that he
                                    was going to be executed, so coming back to
                                    life wasn’t on their minds. So we, looking
                                    back in history, know that he was talking
                                    about coming back to life, but at the time,
                                    they were just very confused and didn’t
                                    understand what he meant. But amazingly, as
                                    well as referring to his resurrection,{' '}
                                    <i>raising</i> also refers to his
                                    crucifixion as the victims on the stakes
                                    were also <i>raised</i>. (See{' '}
                                    <a href='JHN.html#C3V14'>John 3:14</a>.)
                                    Sadly, it’s not usually possible to make a
                                    translation easy to read and understand in
                                    our current times, without losing some of
                                    the underlying meaning or ambiguities or
                                    word-plays that were presented to the
                                    original hearers. That’s exactly why it’s
                                    good to have <em>two</em> different
                                    translations side-by-side!

                                “literal versions”. You’ll quickly notice
                                lighter colours that mark the deemphasis of
                                words that had to be added to make the English
                                sentences even make sense. But there’s at least
                                two other things that aren’t necessarily changed
                                in the English <em>Literal Version</em>:
                                <ol>

                                        Other languages use the negative

                                        doubled or tripled in the sentence. If
                                        you don’t understand this, you could
                                        easily think that the original means the

                                        have to reverse the second negative to
                                        get the expected meaning, ending up with{' '}

                                carefully for how it is translated into modern,
                                idiomatic English before jumping to any
                                conclusions of your own about what the original
                                language or the <em>Literal Version</em> says or
                                doesn’t say.

                            Sadly, mismatches between the English language and
                            the original Biblical languages make some things not
                            very clear to readers of English Bible translations
                            that claim to be literal (including our own):
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li id='faith'>
                                English words based on the root ‘faith’ and
                                those based on ‘believe’ don’t make it obvious
                                that these are usually the same root word in the
                                original languages.
                            </li>
                            <li id='holy'>
                                English words based on the root ‘holy’ and those
                                based on ‘saint’ or ‘sanctify’ don’t make it
                                obvious that these are usually the same root
                                word in the original languages.
                            </li>

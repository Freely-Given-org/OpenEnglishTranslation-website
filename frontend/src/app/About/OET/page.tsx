                        <p>
                            The <em>Readers’ Version</em> (OET-RV) and the{' '}
                            <em>Literal Version</em> (OET-LV) side-by-side,
                            together make up the OET.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So why two versions? Well, many people ask the
                            question:
                            <i>
                                Which English Bible translation should I use?
                            </i>{' '}
                            And often the answer is that there’s no single Bible
                            translation which can meet all of the needs of the
                            thoughtful reader. Why not? It’s because we often
                            have two related desires that we need answered:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                What does the original (Hebrew or Greek) text
                                actually say? and
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                What did the original writer mean? (i.e., What
                                should we understand from it?)
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Our answer has always been that it’s best to use{' '}
                            <b>two</b> translations—one more <b>literal</b> to
                            give a window into the actual Hebrew or Greek words,
                            and one more <b>dynamic</b> that’s easier for us
                            modern readers to understand—as much to do with our
                            quite different cultures as to do with our different
                            languages.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So the <em>OET</em> gives both side-by-side, and
                            with the advantage that both the{' '}
                            <em>Readers’ Version</em> and the{' '}

                            in this way. We suggest reading down the{' '}

                            something stands out and you think in your mind “
                            <i>Does it really say that?</i>” or “
                            <i>Could it really mean that?</i>”, then flick your
                            eyes across to the <em>Literal Version</em> and see
                            for yourself what’s really there in the original
                            texts.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On the other hand if you’ve been reading the Bible
                            for a few decades already, maybe it would be fun to
                            work through the <em>Literal Version</em> to get
                            fresh insight into what’s actually written there in
                            those original languages. It won’t be easy reading,
                            but it should be insightful as the different wording
                            will require more concentration.

                                Part of the motivation comes from our work on
                                the street and door-to-door where we worked hard
                                to explain the Good Message about Jesus to
                                people without any church background. The{' '}
                                <em>Readers’ Version</em> strives to replace
                                jargon and terminology that’s only heard at
                                church with words and phrases that should be
                                understood by modern English speakers.

                                A further goal is to expose more people to some
                                of the background of where our Bibles come from
                                and how translators make decisions, i.e.,{' '}

                                English translation traditions (some going back
                                to the 1500’s) that can possibly be improved.

                                reading experience, but who might benefit by
                                reading the accounts in slightly different words
                                that make it fresh and interesting, and
                                hopefully it will provoke deeper thought into
                                what the original speakers or writers were
                                likely meaning to say.

                                around you. Because the history and legacy of
                                English Bibles now goes back for hundreds of
                                years, many things have been carried over that
                                readers don’t even realise. For example, we
                                might all smile at Yoda saying, “Strong is the
                                force.” That’s because naturally we would say,
                                “The force is strong.” So think about “

                                pages.) But our aim isn’t at all to criticise

                                The <em>Readers’ Version</em> uses section
                                headings which are very helpful to skim through
                                when trying to locate a certain passage.
                                However, you’ll quickly notice that they are

                                Being a 21<span>st</span> century translation
                                done in an era when there is much more effort in
                                general to respect speakers of other languages
                                (including the languages of ethnic minorities in
                                our own countries) and to pronounce their names
                                and placenames correctly, the <em>OET</em>
                                 attempts to do the same for Biblical names and
                                placenames. (All this is a little complex when
                                we have both Hebrew and Greek versions of names
                                and placenames—more below.) Certainly by showing
                                a little more respect for Hebrew names, we hope
                                to make this Bible translation a little more
                                “Jew-friendly”. If you have difficulty following
                                the names in the <em>Literal Version</em>, you

                                placenames more accurate, we’ve also attempted
                                to modernise and simplify the spelling
                                (transliterations) of these names to make it
                                easier for readers to pronounce them as they
                                come across them, e.g., using <b>f</b> instead
                                of <b>ph</b>, so <i>Epafras</i> instead of{' '}
                                <i>Epaphras</i>. (Oddly, even traditional
                                English Bible translations surprisingly do use{' '}

                                more wherever possible. So a word like{' '}
                                <i>baptise</i> (which is an adapted
                                transliteration of the Greek verb), actually
                                gets translated, so this example becomes{' '}

                                Rather than using the archaic and difficult to

                                ‘New Testament’, the <em>OET</em> will use ‘The
                                Hebrew scriptures’ and ‘The Messianic update’ to
                                replace them (and to try to provoke our readers
                                to think, and to learn more about Bible history).

                                problem where most modern books use{' '}
                                <i>italics</i> for <em>emphasis</em> whereas
                                older Bibles use <i>italics</i> for the words
                                which should actually be <b>deemphasised</b>,
                                i.e., the words which actually <b>aren’t</b> in

                                seems to make sense to only use one word
                                consistently rather than using two words for the
                                same thing (just because they came from two
                                different languages), so the <em>OET</em> has
                                elected to only use <i>messiah</i>. However,
                                these words actually have a meaning, just as{' '}
                                <i>President</i> is not just a title, but

                                meetings. So going a step further, we have
                                chosen to use the contemporary <b>meaning</b> of
                                the word in the <em>Literal Version</em>. The

                                but we use the extended meaning which is{' '}

                                Most readers living in modern democracies have
                                never been familiar with the concept of an
                                ancient king or <i>lord</i> who has the power of
                                life and death over them. Thus the title{' '}
                                <i>Lord Jesus</i> is easily said, yet relatively
                                few actually live with Jesus as the lord of
                                their thoughts and actions and daily activities.
                                (Just think how many would embarrassingly rush
                                to turn off the video they’re streaming if Jesus
                                appeared in the room.) As a reaction to the word{' '}
                                <i>Lord</i> seemingly becoming so cliché for

                                <i>master</i> as a way to get readers to at
                                least think a little more about what the concept
                                might mean. (The word <i>boss</i> felt a little
                                informal.)

                                The <em>Literal Version</em> tries to add as

                                the original manuscripts. Of course, we add
                                spaces between words so we can read it faster,
                                and we add capitals at the start of sentences as

                                capitalise words like <i>Kingdom of Heaven</i>{' '}
                                or even <i>He</i> when it refers to Jesus,
                                because the concept of capital and small letters

                                Most dialects of modern English don’t

                                Because the <em>Literal Version</em> so closely
                                follows the original languages, it’s important
                                to remember that words often don’t match
                                one-to-one between languages. This is one reason
                                why the <em>OET-LV</em> reads strangely: because
                                we try to avoid using different English words if
                                we can; knowing that the <em>OET-LV</em> will
                                not be natural English. Again, this is because
                                we want the <em>OET-LV</em> to be a window into
                                what’s actually written in the original
                                languages. For fluent English (like in the{' '}
                                <em>Readers’ Version</em>) the same Greek word
                                might require several different translations
                                when used in different contexts. For example,
                                the Greek word translated <i>raise</i> in the{' '}
                                <em>OET-LV</em> would likely require the

                                    Alert readers might be aware that there’s a
                                    play on words here in the gospels. When
                                    Jesus talked about himself{' '}
                                    <i>being raised up</i>, it was deliberately
                                    ambiguous because his hearers didn’t
                                    understand until right near the end that he
                                    was going to be executed so coming back to
                                    life wasn’t on their minds. So we, looking
                                    back in history, know that he was talking
                                    about coming back to life, but at the time,
                                    they were just very confused and didn’t
                                    understand what he meant. But amazingly, as
                                    well as referring to his resurrection,{' '}
                                    <i>raising</i> also refers to his
                                    crucifixion as the victims on the stakes
                                    were also <i>raised</i>. (See{' '}

                                    Sadly, it’s not usually possible to make a
                                    translation easy to read and understand in
                                    our current times, without losing some of
                                    the underlying meaning or ambiguities or
                                    word-plays that were presented to the
                                    original hearers. That’s exactly why it’s
                                    good to have <em>two</em> different
                                    translations side-by-side!

                                ‘literal’ versions. You’ll quickly notice
                                lighter colours that mark the deemphasis of

                                        Some languages use the negative
                                        differently than English does,
                                        especially when it’s doubled or tripled
                                        in the sentence. If you don’t understand
                                        this, you could easily think that the
                                        original means the opposite of what the
                                        words actually appear to say. For
                                        example the double negative: “You are
                                        <span>_</span> not <span>_</span>caring
                                        <span>_</span>about no one.” (adapted
                                        from Matthew 22:16). In natural, fluent
                                        English, we would have to reverse the
                                        second negative to get the expected
                                        meaning, ending up with <i>anyone</i> as
                                        you’ll find in the{' '}
                                        <em>Readers’ Version</em>. But in Greek,
                                        the second negative <b>adds emphasis</b>{' '}
                                        rather than reversing the first
                                        negative. So our{' '}

                            The <em>Open English Translation</em> of the Bible
                            has been planned since before 2010 and an early
                            draft of the account about Jonah was made around
                            then, but other commitments prevented much progress
                            until it was restarted again in mid-2022.

                            The initial vision came after Robert Hunt switched
                            from Windows to Linux on his laptop used for Bible
                            translation in the Philippines. (This was mostly
                            done to avoid the spread of computer viruses.) After
                            some time, he came to realise that the components
                            and programs used on the free Linux operating system
                            had all been donated by clever programmers, but this
                            was in contrast to the Bible resources on the same
                            laptop that were all encrypted and their use was
                            tightly controlled. This didn’t seem to match either
                            the origin of the scriptures nor did it match the
                            theme of Jesus’ gift to mankind. (Shouldn’t
                            Christians be <em>more</em> generous than secular
                            programmers, not less? Isn’t the Bible often called
                            ‘God’s’ word? Even today, it’s much easier to find a
                            pornography download on the internet than to find a
                            free, modern Bible text download that you could use
                            in your own app or on your own website. Try finding
                            one—you’ll find plenty of apps but not the source

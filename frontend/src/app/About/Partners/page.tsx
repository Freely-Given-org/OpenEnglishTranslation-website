                            side-by-side), plus the fact that <em>OET</em>

                            there’s no book named ‘James’. Also, terms like ‘New

                            Are you a <i>word-crafter</i>? As <em>OET</em> books
                            are being drafted, we need readers to look at the
                            English style. When translating, it’s sometimes
                            difficult to get the Greek words and word order out
                            of your mind and to think about how we’d get the
                            same thing across in our modern English. Other times
                            we might have chosen a modern idiom, but one that’s
                            not well-known in other English-speaking nations. So
                            we need readers to let us know if they can help make
                            the <em>Readers’ Version</em> more fluent and
                            natural.

                        <p>
                            If you’re a Bible translation consultant and/or a
                            Hebrew or Greek expert, we would value your help in
                            checking our drafts for accuracy and also for making
                            suggestions for improvement. Perhaps you could keep
                            the <em>OET</em> in a small window while you’re
                            checking a translation in another language. Any

                        <p>
                            Because the <em>OET</em> is a fresh translation from
                            the Hebrew and Greek (and not based on other English
                            translations), there’s a higher chance that our
                            initial drafts will contain errors, i.e., there’s
                            many places in an English Bible translation where
                            the meaning of the original writer could be
                            interpreted differently. That’s ok, unless we’ve
                            interpreted the original languages wrongly! We don’t
                            want that.

                            The <em>OET</em> dream is actually a huge one that
                            could extend towards other languages beyond English.
                            Did you know that in many less prominent languages
                            of the world, the names of the Bible characters were
                            adapted or transliterated from the major language
                            (e.g., English or Spanish or French) names, and not
                            from the Hebrew or Greek names? So that means in
                            some cases for example, the people’s Hebrew names
                            were translated in Greek, then into English or
                            Spanish, etc., then into the country’s national
                            language, and then into the country’s minority
                            languages. Could this be improved? Not easily
                            because of the power of tradition, but that doesn’t
                            mean that it’s impossible.

                            Did you know that the NZ Māori (Te Reo Māori) Bible
                            does not necessarily use their best term for God (
                            <i>Atua</i>)? Wow, changing that now would be a huge
                            change! Also, did you know that some important
                            Biblical terms were just invented instead of
                            translated. For example, Eph. 6:2, “<b>Honour</b>{' '}
                            your father and mother…” became “Whaka<b>honor</b>
                            etia tou papa me tou whaea…”. Could this be
                            improved? Yes, it could! Similarly for Rom. 2:10,
                            “but <b>glory</b>, honor and peace for everyone…”
                            became “He <b>kororia</b> ia, he honore, he
                            rangimarie, …”.

                            What about <em>your</em> language? Could the Bible
                            translation you use be improved? Are the commercial
                            Bible publishing companies interested in doing this?
                            If not, maybe we could work together with you?

                                the Bible translation world can also be

                            focus on completing, checking, and improving the
                            Bible text itself.

                                copy of the two-column <em>OET</em> with two
                                gospels using PTXprint, but we’re ready now to
                                start looking at something more serious.)

                            We also need financial help for this project to
                            advance at full speed. Although most of the work is
                            done by volunteers, we do need to cover our
                            computing costs (domain names, servers and services,
                            internet, electricity) as well as books and
                            reference materials, travel and conferences. Then
                            there’s also printing costs—only for small test runs
                            of Bible portions at this stage. We would also like
                            to be able to pay for services from contract
                            programmers and web developers. Again, please use

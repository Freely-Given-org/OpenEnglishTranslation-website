                            One important factor in providing a tagged Bible
                            translation for free use in Bible apps and programs
                            in this modern computer age, is that{' '}

                            . Hence, Freely-Given.org has invested in designing
                            Bible databases and file formats that themselves are
                            offered to the Bible software world as a gift to use

                            just in the ways the Bible text is translated and
                            how it’s presented to the user, but also how it’s
                            saved on computers and linked to helpful databases.
                            And we are ‘splitters’ rather than ‘lumpers’ because
                            we try to provide detailed information, even if it’s
                            only discarded later.

                                , i.e., the intent of the original author is
                                unclear and our best attempt might actually be
                                wrong. (Often in those cases, we’ll simply leave
                                the word-for-word literal text in the Readers’
                                Version where it’s unclear, but in some cases,
                                even that isn’t at all understandable.)

                        <p>
                            We are planning to annotate the type of all of our
                            notes to enable some notes to be added or removed
                            for specific online or printed <em>OET</em>
                             editions. Plus we plan/hope to get specialists to
                            write additional footnote and cross-reference sets,
                            e.g., for a Muslim or a Jew reading this English
                            translation, or for a specialist archeological
                            edition, etc.

                        <p>
                            For annotating footnote types, we are currently
                            testing the addition of a code at the beginning of
                            the initial <b>\ft</b> field, e.g., ‘TC: ’ to
                            indicate a note on textual criticism. More to come…

                        <h3>Hebrew parallelism</h3>
                        <p>
                            Hebrew poetry doesn't use rhyming like a lot of
                            English poetry does, but (like English), it does
                            often use shortish lines and often these come in
                            pairs or doublets.

                            The <em>OET-RV</em> marks the second line of
                            doublets with the <b>≈</b> character (commonly used
                            in mathematics for ‘approximately equal’) to alert
                            the reader when we consider that the author seems to
                            be repeating a similar thought in the second line of
                            a doublet. (This character will usually follow the
                            space after a \q1 or \q2 field.)

                            For example, we might code something like:

                             \q1 God is my hope.
                            <br />
                             \q1 <b>≈</b>Yahweh gives me comfort.

                                <b>≈</b> character is used with the \add
                                character field (see above).
